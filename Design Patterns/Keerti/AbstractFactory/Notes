Factory design pattern was creating concrete classes or objects.

AbstractFactory is going to create factories that is going to create objects.
Here we use AbstractFactory to create different factories.
Here VechileFactory is the AbstractFactory.

Client is going to use VechileFactory to create Car and Bike.
Client is going to tell VechileFactory what company it wants Hyundai or Toyota.
Depending on that VechileFactory will create Hyndai or Toyota Factory. (this is the extra layer compared to factory design pattern).

Similarly we have button and textbox example
