/*
Where Static Variables Reside in RAM
Static variables (whether global, local, or class member static variables) do not reside in the stack. They also do not reside in the heap unless dynamically allocated.

They are stored in the Data Segment of the RAM.

a. Initialized Static Variables:
These are stored in the Initialized Data Segment. If you declare a static variable and initialize it,
like static int x = 5;, it will reside in the Initialized Data Segment.

Example:

static int count = 0; // Initialized static variable
When the program starts, the Operating System (OS) loads the variable count into the Initialized Data Segment of RAM.
It will hold the value 0 until it is changed during the program's execution. The value is retained throughout the
programâ€™s lifetime.

b. Uninitialized Static Variables:
These are stored in the BSS Segment of the Data Segment. Static variables that do not have an explicit initializer
are placed here, and they are initialized to zero (or NULL for pointers) by the system at the time the program starts.

Example:

static int count; // Uninitialized static variable
Since count is uninitialized, the system will place it in the BSS Segment, and it will be set to zero at program startup.
