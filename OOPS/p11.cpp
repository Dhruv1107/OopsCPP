// friend function
// Refer: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/friend
// The friend declaration appears in a class body and grants a function or another class access to private and protected members of the class where the friend declaration appears.
// Most commonly used in operator overloading
#include <iostream>

};

    // We are giving PrintPrivateMemberVariable function the permission to access the private variables
    // it doesnt matter as long as it is declared in the class
    // So basically this function is my friend and he can access my private info
    PrivateSecurityInfo m_info; // since we declared this class as friend in PrivateSecurityInfo, we can access its private members

    /*
    In C++, friend classes are given special access to a class's private and protected members.
    This means that a friend class can access the private and protected members of the class that declares
    it as a friend, even though these members would otherwise be inaccessible to regular classes outside the class.

    However, even though a friend class has special access to another class's private/protected members,
    it does not inherit those access rights. This means that the friend class cannot automatically access
    the private/protected members of its own derived classes or its base classes just because it is a friend
    to another class.

    A friend class is not part of the class hierarchy of the class itâ€™s a friend to,
    and it doesn't gain any "inheritance rights" to access members of other classes unless explicitly granted.
